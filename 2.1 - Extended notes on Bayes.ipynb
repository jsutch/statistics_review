If presented with related base rate information (i.e. generic, general information) and specific information (information pertaining only to a certain case), the mind tends to ignore the former and focus on the latter. Base rate neglect is a specific form of the more general extension neglect. \n",

The unknown quantity may be a parameter of the model or a latent variable rather than an observable variable. \n",

    "**Rule 1 – Remember your priors!**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier how easy it is to fall for the base rate neglect trap. The underlying proportion in the population is often times neglected and we as human beings have a tendency to just focus on just the attribute. Think of priors as the underlying or the background knowledge which is essentially an additional bit of information in addition to the likelihood. A product of the priors together with likelihood determines the posterior odds/probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 2 – Question your existing belief**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is somewhat tricky and counter-intuitive to grasp but question your priors. Present yourself with a hypothesis what if your priors were irrelevant or even wrong? How will that affect your posterior probability? Would the new posterior probability be any different than the existing one if your priors are irrelevant or even wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 3 – Update incrementally**\n",
    "\n",
    "We live in a dynamic world where evidence and attributes are constantly shifting. While it is okay to believe in well-tested priors and likelihoods in the present moment. However, always question does my priors & likelihood still hold true today? In other words, update your beliefs incrementally as new information or evidence surfaces. A good example of this would be the shifting sentiments of the financial markets. What holds true today, may not tomorrow? Hence, the priors and likelihoods must also be incrementally updated.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Traditional testing (the type you probably came across in elementary stats or AP stats) is called Non-Bayesian. It is how often an outcome happens over repeated runs of the experiment. It’s an objective view of whether an experiment is repeatable.\n",
    "- Bayesian hypothesis testing is a subjective view of the same thing. It takes into account how much faith you have in your results. In other words, would you wager money on the outcome of your experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences Between Traditional and Bayesian Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional testing (Non Bayesian) requires you to repeat sampling over and over, while Bayesian testing does not. The main different between the two is in the first step of testing: stating a probability model. \n",
    "- In Bayesian testing you add prior knowledge to this step. It also requires use of a posterior probability, which is the conditional probability given to a random event after all the evidence is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Arguments for Bayesian Testing**  \n",
    "Many researchers think that it is a better alternative to traditional testing, because it:\n",
    "- Includes prior knowledge about the data.\n",
    "- Takes into account personal beliefs about the results.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's five reasons why frequentists methods may be preferred:**\n",
    "- **Faster.** Given that Bayesian statistics often give nearly identical answers to frequentist answers (and when they don't, it's not 100% clear that Bayesian is always the way to go), the fact that frequentist statistics can be obtained often several orders of magnitude faster is a strong argument. Likewise, frequentist methods do not require as much memory to store the results. While these things may seem somewhat trivial, especially with smaller datasets, the fact that Bayesian and Frequentist typically agree in results (especially if you have lots of informative data) means that if you are going to care, you may start caring about the less important things. And of course, if you live in the big data world, these are not trivial at all.\n",
    "- **Non-parametric statistics.** I recognize that Bayesian statistics does have non-parametric statistics, but I would argue that the frequentist side of the field has some truly undeniably practical tools, such as the Empirical Distribution Function. No method in the world will ever replace the EDF, nor the Kaplan Meier curves, etc. (although clearly that's not to say those methods are the end of an analysis).\n",
    "- **Less diagnostics.** MCMC methods, the most common method for fitting Bayesian models, typically require more work by the user than their frequentist counter part. Usually, the diagnostic for an MLE estimate is so simple that any good algorithm implementation will do it automatically (although that's not to say every available implementation is good...). As such, frequentist algorithmic diagnostics is typically \"make sure there's no red text when fitting the model\". Given that all statisticians have limited bandwidth, this frees up more time to ask questions like \"is my data really approximately normal?\" or \"are these hazards really proportional?\", etc.\n",
    "- **Valid inference under model misspecification.** We've all heard that \"All models are wrong but some are useful\", but different areas of research take this more or less seriously. The Frequentist literature is full of methods for fixing up inference when the model is misspecified: bootstrap estimator, cross-validation, sandwich estimator (link also discusses general MLE inference under model misspecification), generalized estimation equations (GEE's), quasi-likelihood methods, etc. As far as I know, there is very little in the Bayesian literature about inference under model misspecification (although there's a lot of discussion of model checking, i.e., posterior predictive checks). I don't think this just by chance: evaluating how an estimator behaves over repeated trials does not require the estimator to be based on a \"true\" model, but using Bayes theorem does!\n",
    "- **Freedom from the prior (this is probably the most common reason for why people don't use Bayesian methods for everything).** The strength of the Bayesian standpoint is often touted as the use of priors. However, in all of the applied fields I have worked in, the idea of an informative prior in the analysis is not considered. Reading literature on how to elicit priors from non-statistical experts gives good reasoning for this; I've read papers that say things like (cruel straw-man like paraphrasing my own) \"Ask the researcher who hired you because they have trouble understanding statistics to give a range that they are 90% certain the effect size they have trouble imagining will be in. This range will typically be too narrow, so arbitrarily try to get them to widen it a little. Ask them if their belief looks like a gamma distribution. You will probably have to draw a gamma distribution for them, and show how it can have heavy tails if the shape parameter is small. This will also involve explaining what a PDF is to them.\"(note: I don't think even statisticians are really able to accurately say a priori whether they are 90% or 95% certain whether the effect size lies in a range, and this difference can have a substantial effect on the analysis!). Truth be told, I'm being quite unkind and there may be situations where eliciting a prior may be a little more straightforward. But you can see how this is a can of worms. Even if you switch to non-informative priors, it can still be a problem; when transforming parameters, what are easily mistaken for non-informative priors suddenly can be seen as very informative! Another example of this is that I've talked with several researchers who adamantly do not want to hear what another expert's interpretation of the data is because empirically, the other experts tend to be over confident. They'd rather just know what can be inferred from the other expert's data and then come to their own conclusion. I can't recall where I heard it, but somewhere I read the phrase \"if you're a Bayesian, you want everyone to be a Frequentist\". I interpret that to mean that theoretically, if you're a Bayesian and someone describes their analysis results, you should first try to remove the influence of their prior and then figure out what the impact would be if you had used your own. This little exercise would be simplified if they had given you a confidence interval rather than a credible interval!\n",
    "- Of course, if you abandon informative priors, there is still utility in Bayesian analyses. Personally, this where I believe their highest utility lies; there are some problems that are extremely hard to get any answer from in using MLE methods but can be solved quite easily with MCMC. But my view on this being Bayesian's highest utility is due to strong priors on my part, so take it with a grain of salt.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC): This set of techniques starts with a set of known summary statistics. A second set of the same statistics is calculated from a variety of potential models, and the candidates are placed in an acceptance/rejection loop. ABC favors those candidates that more closely match the known summary statistics (Medhi, 2014).\n",
    "- Admissible decision rule: A decision rule is a guideline to help you support or reject a null hypothesis. Generally, speaking, a decision rule is “admissible” if it is better than the set of all other possible decision rules. It’s similar to the line of best fit in regression analysis: it’s not a perfect fit, but it’s “good enough.”\n",
    "- Bayesian efficiency: An efficient design requires you to input parameter values; In a Bayesian efficient model you have to take your “best guess” at what those parameters might be. Figuring out what is an efficient design (and what isn’t) by hand is only possible for very small designs, as it’s a computationally complex process (Hess & Daly, 2010).\n",
    "- Bayes’ theorem: see Bayes Theorem Problems\n",
    "- Bayes factor: the Bayes factor is a measure of relative likelihood between two hypotheses, or what Cornfield (1976) calls the “relative betting odds.” The factor ranges between zero and infinity, where values close to zero are evidence against the null hypothesis and evidence for the alternate hypothesis (Spiegelhalter, D. et. al, 2004).\n",
    "- Bayesian network: A directed acyclic graph that represents a set of variables and their associated dependencies.\n",
    "- Bayesian linear regression: treats regression coefficients and errors as random variables, instead of fixed unknowns. This tends to make the model more intuitive and flexible. However, the results are similar to simple linear regression if priors are uninformative and N is much greater than P (i.e. when the number of items is much greater than the number of prior distributions).\n",
    "- Bayesian estimator: Also called a Bayes action, the Bayes estimator is defined as a minimizer of Bayes risk. In more general terms, it’s a single number that summarizes information found in a prior distribution about a particular parameter.\n",
    "- Bayesian Information Criterion (also called the Schwarz criterion): given a set of models to choose from, you should choose the model with the lowest BIC.\n",
    "- Bernstein–von Mises theorem: This is the Bayesian equivalent of the asymptotic normality results in the asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (Ghosh & Ramamoorthi, 2006, p.33).\n",
    "- Conjugate prior: A conjugate prior has the same distribution as your posterior prior. For example, if you’re studying people’s weights, which are normally distributed, you can use a normal distribution of weights as your conjugate prior.\n",
    "- Credible interval: a range of values where an unobserved parameter falls with a certain subjective probability. It is the Bayesian equivalent of a confidence interval in frequentist statistics.\n",
    "- Cromwell’s rule: This simple rule states that you should not assign probabilities of 0 (an event will not happen) or 1 (an event will happen), except when you can demonstrate an event is logically true or false. For example, the event 5 + 5 will logically add up to 10, so you can apply a probability of 1 to it.\n",
    "- Empirical Bayes method: a technique where the prior distribution is estimated from actual data. This is unlike the usual Bayesian methods, where the prior distribution is fixed at the beginning of an experiment.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter: a parameter from the prior distribution that’s set before the experiment begins.\n",
    "- Likelihood function: A measurement of how well the data summarizes these parameters. See: What is the Likelihood function?\n",
    "- Maximum a posteriori estimation: An estimate of an unknown; It is equal to the mode of the posterior distribution.\n",
    "- Maximum entropy principle: This principle states that if you are estimating a probability distribution, you should select the distribution which gives you the maximum uncertainty (entropy).\n",
    "- Posterior probability: Posterior probability is the probability an event will happen after all evidence or background information has been taken into account. See: What is Posterior Probability?\n",
    "- Principle of indifference: states that if you have no reason to expect one event will happen over another, all events should be given the same probability.\n"
